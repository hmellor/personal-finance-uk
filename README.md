A collection of utilities and notebooks for analysing your finances.

I found the tools available online to be black boxes that were usually not as configurable as I would have liked.
This is what lead me to create the tools you'll find in this repository.

## Usage

You can either:

- Clone this repo and run the notebooks locally
- Open this repository directly in Google Colab <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HMellor/personal-finance-uk">
